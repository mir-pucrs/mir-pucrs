Including components from hackathons and unconferences, as well as parallel educational sessions, Brainhack fosters novel collaborations around the interests of its attendees. Here we provide an overview of its structure, past events, and example projects. Additionally, we outline current innovations such as regional events and post-conference publications. Through introducing Brainhack to the wider neuroscience community, we hope to provide a unique conference format that promotes the features of collaborative, open science.",

abstract = "Abstract Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or unexpected behaviour if left unconstrained. Norms have been widely proposed as a means of defining and enforcing societal constraints by using the deontic concepts of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe what must, may and should not be done, respectively. However, recent efforts to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that guide plan choices suffer from interfering with an agent×³s reasoning process, and thus limit the agent×³s autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In this paper we describe an extension of the Beliefs, Desires, Intentions (BDI) architecture that enables normative reasoning used to help agents choose and customise plans taking norms into account. The paper makes three significant contributions: we provide a formal framework to represent norms compactly and to manage them; we present a formal characterisation of the normative positions induced by norms of an agent×³s execution within a given time period; and finally, we put forth a mechanism for plan selection and ranking taking into consideration a set of normative restrictions.

abstract = { ABSTRACT Agent programming languages have often avoided the use of automated (first principles or hierarchical) planners in favour of predefined plan/recipe libraries for computational efficiency reasons. This allows for very efficient agent reasoning cycles, but limits the autonomy and flexibility of the resulting agents, oftentimes with deleterious effects on the agent's performance. Planning agents can, for instance, synthesise a new plan to achieve a goal for which no predefined recipe worked, or plan to make viable the precondition of a recipe belonging to a goal being pursued. Recent work on integrating automated planning with belief-desire-intention (BDI)-style agent architectures has yielded a number of systems and programming languages that exploit the efficiency of standard BDI reasoning, as well as the flexibility of generating new recipes at runtime. In this paper, we survey these efforts and point out directions for future work. }

abstract = {Human users planning for multiple objectives in complex environments are subjected to high levels of cognitive workload, which can severely impair the quality of the plans created. This paper describes a software agent that can proactively assist cognitively overloaded users by providing normative reasoning about prohibitions and obligations so that the user can focus on her primary objectives. In order to provide proactive assistance, we develop the notion of prognostic normative reasoning (PNR) that consists of the following steps: (1) recognizing the user's planned activities, (2) reasoning about norms to evaluate those predicted activities, and (3) providing necessary assistance so that the user's activities are consistent with norms. The idea of PNR integrates various AI techniques, namely, user intention recognition, normative reasoning over a user's intention, and planning, execution and replanning for assistive actions. In this paper, we describe an agent architecture for PNR and discuss practical applications.}

In this context, an electronic contract provides a specification of the expected behaviours of individual services, with the assumption that these services are often enacted by autonomous agents. Using the theoretical tools created by the project, in this paper we describe the complete life cycle of instantiating an electronic contracting system using the contract framework within the aerospace aftercare domain. Thus, we use a natural language description of parts of the types of contracts used in this domain to generate individual norms amenable to a computational representation, and how these norms are used to generate a concrete contract monitor. Moreover, we describe a concrete implementation of contract agents in the AgentSpeak(L) language and how these agents interact within a concrete instantiation of contract.}
