abstract = "Abstract Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or unexpected behaviour if left unconstrained. Norms have been widely proposed as a means of defining and enforcing societal constraints by using the deontic concepts of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe what must, may and should not be done, respectively. However, recent efforts to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that guide plan choices suffer from interfering with an agent×³s reasoning process, and thus limit the agent×³s autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In this paper we describe an extension of the Beliefs, Desires, Intentions (BDI) architecture that enables normative reasoning used to help agents choose and customise plans taking norms into account. The paper makes three significant contributions: we provide a formal framework to represent norms compactly and to manage them; we present a formal characterisation of the normative positions induced by norms of an agent×³s execution within a given time period; and finally, we put forth a mechanism for plan selection and ranking taking into consideration a set of normative restrictions.

abstract = { ABSTRACT Agent programming languages have often avoided the use of automated (first principles or hierarchical) planners in favour of predefined plan/recipe libraries for computational efficiency reasons. This allows for very efficient agent reasoning cycles, but limits the autonomy and flexibility of the resulting agents, oftentimes with deleterious effects on the agent's performance. Planning agents can, for instance, synthesise a new plan to achieve a goal for which no predefined recipe worked, or plan to make viable the precondition of a recipe belonging to a goal being pursued. Recent work on integrating automated planning with belief-desire-intention (BDI)-style agent architectures has yielded a number of systems and programming languages that exploit the efficiency of standard BDI reasoning, as well as the flexibility of generating new recipes at runtime. In this paper, we survey these efforts and point out directions for future work. }

This paper describes a software agent that can proactively assist cognitively overloaded users by providing normative reasoning about prohibitions and obligations so that the user can focus on her primary objectives. In order to provide proactive assistance, we develop the notion of prognostic normative reasoning (PNR) that consists of the following steps: (1) recognizing the user's planned activities, (2) reasoning about norms to evaluate those predicted activities, and (3) providing necessary assistance so that the user's activities are consistent with norms. The idea of PNR integrates various AI techniques, namely, user intention recognition, normative reasoning over a user's intention, and planning, execution and replanning for assistive actions. In this paper, we describe an agent architecture for PNR and discuss practical applications.}

In this context, an electronic contract provides a specification of the expected behaviours of individual services, with the assumption that these services are often enacted by autonomous agents. Using the theoretical tools created by the project, in this paper we describe the complete life cycle of instantiating an electronic contracting system using the contract framework within the aerospace aftercare domain. Thus, we use a natural language description of parts of the types of contracts used in this domain to generate individual norms amenable to a computational representation, and how these norms are used to generate a concrete contract monitor. Moreover, we describe a concrete implementation of contract agents in the AgentSpeak(L) language and how these agents interact within a concrete instantiation of contract.}

	keywords = {Planning; Visualization; Metaphor},
	abstract = {While domain descriptions are often shared and manipulated through diagrams, most complex domains are still described using text-based languages. Code becomes an intermediary between the real-world and an abstract idea, and the programmer is merely a converter of diagrams into code. For automated planning this is no different. The state transition function is described in terms of a textual representation of actions and, although simple actions require little effort to define by the user, the learning process is often slow. New users have no metaphor to help them to visualize the domain description that they are working on and little information about why a planner fails due to formalization errors. In this paper, we propose a visual abstraction for both the planning domain actions and the planning process itself, to facilitate the design of classical planning domains. Using this abstraction, we expect to improve the learning curve for defining and subsequently diagnosing problems with new planning domains.},

abstract = {In the context of a business process modeled by commitments, agents enact a protocol by carrying out goals that service their part of commitments. 
In a competitive or even in a cooperative setting, an agent does not know for sure that its partners will successfully act on their part of the commitments. 
We introduce uncertainty into a successful recent approach of planning first-order commitment protocols. 
Probabilities reflect a semantics of the belief of an agent about the successful completion of tasks by other agents within the protocol, capturing notions of trust. 
We take a deterministic Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner, introduce probabilities into the task networks, and derive a protocol enactment which maximizes expected utility from the point of view of one agent.  We illustrate our approach on a business scenario in e-commerce.},

  pages = {1743--1744},
abstract = {When entering a system, an agent should be aware of the obligations and prohibitions (collectively norms) that will affect it.  Several solutions to this norm identification problem have been proposed, which make use of observations of either other's norm compliant, or norm violating, behaviour. These solutions fail in situations where norms are typically violated, or complied with, respectively. In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach to norm identification which operates by learning from both norm compliant and norm violating behaviour. By utilising both types of behaviour, our work not only overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches, but also yields improved performance over the state-of-the-art. We evaluate its effectiveness empirically, showing, under certain conditions, high accuracy scores.},

  abstract = {Choosing actions within norm-regulated environments involves balancing achieving one's goals and coping with any penalties for non-compliant behaviour. This choice becomes more complicated in environments where there is uncertainty. In this paper, we address the question of choosing actions in environments where there is uncertainty regarding both the outcomes of agent actions and the intensity of monitoring for norm violations. Our technique assumes no prior knowledge of probabilities over action outcomes or the likelihood of norm violations being detected by employing reinforcement learning to discover both the dynamics of the environment and the effectiveness of the enforcer. Results indicate agents become aware of greater rewards for violations when enforcement is lax, which gradually become less attractive as the enforcement is increased.},

Moreover, real environments are dynamic, which can generate unpredictable events that can lead the robots to failure. This paper presents a highly abstract cooperative fault diagnostic method for a team of mobile robots described on a programming environment based on ROS (Robot Operating System) and the Jason multi-agent framework. When a robot detects a failure, it can perform two types of diagnostic methods: a local method executed on the faulty robot itself and a cooperative method where another robot helps the faulty robot to determine the source of failure. A case study demonstrates the success of the approach on two turtlebots.},

  pages = {389--396},
abstract = {Plan recognition has been widely used in agents that need to infer which plans are being executed or which activities are being performed by others. In many applications reasoning and acting in response to plan recognition requires time. In such systems, plan recognition is expected to be made not only with precision, but also in a timely fashion. When recognition cannot be made in time, the plan recognition agent can interact with the observed agents to disambiguate multiple hypotheses, however, such an intrusive behavior is either not possible, very costly, or undesirable. In this paper, we focus on the problem of deciding when to interact with the observed agents in order to determine their plans under execution. To tackle this problem, we develop a plan recognizer that, on the one hand is the least intrusive possible, and on the other hand, attempts to recognize the plans of the observed agents with precision as soon as possible and no later than it is viable to respond to the recognized plan.},

  abstract = {Norms have been used in multiagent systems as a standard description of agents’ behaviors. A lot of effort has been put in formalizing norms and utilizing them in agents’ decision making. Most of this work focuses on two types of norms: prohibitions and obligations. Agents may have incomplete knowledge about norms in a system for several reasons, such as, deficient norms identification techniques or because norms are not fixed and they may change and emerge, etc. In this work we argue that, by assuming that agents do not have complete knowledge of the norms within a system permission norms are fundamental for modeling unknown normative states. Using Event Calculus, we propose a formal representation of permission norm and we show how to use it in agent normative practical reasoning. A simple mineral mining scenario has been used to demonstrate our work, which was implemented in a popular agent programming language.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of relating an agent's internal state (its beliefs and goals) and its social state (its commitments to and from other agents) as a way to develop a comprehensive account of decision making by agents in a multiagent system.  We model this problem in terms of hierarchical task networks (HTNs) and show how HTN planning provides a natural representation and reasoning framework for goals and commitments.  Our approach combines a domain-independent theory capturing the lifecycles of goals and commitments, generic patterns of reasoning, and domain models.  Specifically, our approach shows how each agent may take into account its capabilities, costs, and preferences as it plans its interactions (captured as operations on commitments) with other agents to attempt to achieve its goals.},

  abstract = {Societal rules, as exemplified by norms, aim to provide a degree of behavioural stability to multi-agent societies. Norms regulate a society using the deontic concepts of permissions, obligations and prohibitions to specify what can, must and must not occur in a society. Many implementations of normative systems assume various combinations of the following assumptions: that the set of norms is static and defined at design time; that agents joining a society are instantly informed of the complete set of norms; that the set of agents within a society does not change; and that all agents are aware of the existing norms. When any one of these assumptions is dropped, agents need a mechanism to identify the set of norms currently present within a society, or risk unwittingly violating the norms. In this paper, we develop a norm identification mechanism that uses a combination of parsing-based plan recognition and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning mechanisms, which operates by analysing the actions performed by other agents. While our basic mechanism cannot learn in situations where norm violations take place, we describe an extension which is able to operate in the presence of violations.},
